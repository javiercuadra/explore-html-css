# Exploring HTML and CSS
## Building a modern site using only HTML and CSS

I am building this project to expand my knowledge of HTML and CSS and to
fortify the knowledge I already have. This project will be an excellent
viewing ground for anyone who wants to see my HTML and CSS chops. My hope
is to use every type of HTML tag that does not involve scripts, so I can
have an in depth understanding of each tag. Eventually, I would like to
explore each type of attribute associated with those tags, including
accessibility-related tags such as WAI-ARIA, and other metadata related
tags in the head of the document.

Likewise, I want to explore all the available CSS styles, and utilize best
practices such as a mobile-first design approach, inlining important CSS
styles to prevent CSS blocking in the Critical Path when rendering in a
browser, moving away from media queries for responsiveness, accessibility,
and many more.

I will also provide some level of documentation in this project, so my
examples can help budding new developers understand what I did and why I
did it, should they ever come across my page, and more seasonsed developers
to notice the thoroughness of this project.

Thank you for joining me in this journey. Let us begin.
